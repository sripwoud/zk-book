# 2. [Group Theory](https://www.rareskills.io/post/group-theory-and-coding)

**Exercise: Integers (positive and negative) are not a group under multiplication. Explain why.**

The set of integers is not a group under multiplication because it does not satisfy the inverse property.  
For example, the inverse of 2 is 1/2, which is not an integer.  
One would need rational numbers to form a group under multiplication.
